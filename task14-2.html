        <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes
          that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation
          to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so can now dive deep into CSS layout,
          looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and new fangled
